echo "Don't forget to set up your nginx local site!

Something like:
cd /etc/nginx/sites-available/
ln -s /srv/chat-app/conf/chat.local
cd ../sites-enables
ln -s ../sites-available/chat.local

You'll also need to add chat.local and api.chat.local to your localhost entry in /etc/hosts, I don't want to mess with your hosts
file, so I leave that to you!"
